## Installation

The official installation method is using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). Please install both tools according to their documentation.

If you want to make RTMPie available under a publicly accessible domain (e.g. demo.rtmpie.de), make sure to set up the necessary DNS settings before continuing.

When Docker is installed, proceed with installing RTMPie:

```bash
# Create a directory for the installation and change the working directory
mkdir /opt/rtmpie
cd /opt/rtmpie

# Download the small installer script
wget -q -O setup.sh https://github.com/keyiflerolsun/rtmpie/blob/main/setup.sh?raw=True

# Make the script executable
chmod +x setup.sh

# Run the installer and answer the questions
bash setup.sh

# Start the containers
docker compose up -d
```

The webinteface will be available after a few seconds and you can login using the default credentials `admin / admin`.

#### Stream Example

```bash
ffmpeg -re -i 'https://meclistv-live.ercdn.net/meclistv/meclistv_720p.m3u8' \
	-c:v libx264 -preset veryfast -b:v 1M -c:a aac -b:a 128k -f flv \
